# DS-project

This is a Data Science project, in which we built a machine learning model, with the goal to predict weather a patient with HCC would survive or not after one year.The dataset we used was from 165 patients from Coimbra Hospital and University Center.

In order to run this code, it's necessary to have python installed in your system. It's also necessary to use either Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook.
The main libraries we used for the project were:pandas, numpy seaborn, matplotlib, math, sklearn (preprocessing, model_selection,tree, neighbours,metrics ), scikit-learn, and copy.

To run this code, you'll need the files: hcc_dataset.csv and encoded_hcc.csv
